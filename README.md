# 🥁 Drum Kit Web App

This is an interactive **Drum Kit** project that I built to practice JavaScript, event handling, and DOM manipulation. Press keys or click the buttons to play drum sounds and see visual feedback.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**

## 🎮 How It Works

- The webpage displays drum buttons labeled with letters (e.g., `w`, `a`, `s`, etc.).
- Pressing a corresponding keyboard key or clicking a button plays a drum sound.
- Each key has a unique drum audio and visual animation when triggered.

## 🎧 Features

- Keypress and mouse click event listeners
- Drum sounds using the `Audio` object in JavaScript
- Button animation when keys are pressed
- Fully responsive layout
